    <h1><strong>WEEK 1 ASSESMENT ENTRY</strong></h1>
    <p>My name is <strong>Shoaga Awawu</strong> and this is my entry for my week 1 assesment
    <br>
    I love front-end development because it allows me to bring ideas to life. 
    <br>
    i am particularly drawn to modern technologies, these are skills i wish to master to stay ahead in my career 
<br>
So far with <em>Revslon</em>, I have gotten familiar with using essential tags like like h1 to h6 for headings, p for paragraphs, etc.
<br>I understad how to use css to style elements. For example, i can change background color of webpage, set margins and padding and adjust font size. 
<br>initially it was challenging to understand, but after much practice, i now know how to manage margins, paddings and borders effectively
